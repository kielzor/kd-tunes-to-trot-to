# Tunes to Trot To

## This is a comprehensive music application made for runners to create and implement custom workout routines.  It is catered specifically around the idea of staggered running paces, and will give the user control over when their pace should change by changing the music accordingly.  It has three different speeds to be selected and different preprogrammed durations for all three of those speeds and the overall workout. All sounds were brought in from the freesound.org api and more are coming soon! Also coming soon is the ability to import tracks manually for a full user experience. 

## This application was made with React, Redux, Router, CSS, and Javascript. It was tested with Enzyme and Jest.

### To run this application, clone the repo and run npm install and npm start in the terminal. It should open on localhost3000.
