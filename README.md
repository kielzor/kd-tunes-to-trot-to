# Tunes to Trot To

## This is a comprehensive music application made for runners to create and implement custom workout routines.  It is catered specifically around the idea of staggered running paces, and will give the user control over when their pace should change by changing the music accordingly.  It has three different speeds to be selected and different preprogrammed durations for all three of those speeds and the overall workout. All sounds were brought in from the freesound.org api and more are coming soon! Also coming soon is the ability to import tracks manually for a full user experience.
